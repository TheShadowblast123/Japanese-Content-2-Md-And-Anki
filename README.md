# Japanese Content 2 Md And Anki
 A personal tool for taking Japanese content and making a mind map and flashcards out of it.

There are no plans to make the UX any better as the current state satisfies my needs.
Meant for use with Obsidian, Obsidian to anki and Another obsidian plugin I'm current'y searching for

## Why?: The Problem and solution
### The Way the Mind Processes Information

To teach a topic, it's easiest and most reasonable to make the content of each lesson top down, this is such that you learn about a particular part of the subject matter from begining to end and you repeat this process until you have mastery over the entire topic. This is not how the mind processes information. The nuerons in our brain are a network that tries to be as lazy as possible, discarding anything deemed unnecessary and holding on to critical information. Because of this, memories are stronger whenever we associate them with something we already have in our minds, and this is the greatest flaw of flash cards

Flash cards are a great learning tool, but they usually only ever give us one association. What this essentially means if you lose the association, you lose the memory. We've all had a moment where there's something that we've forgotten and later on we realize that we already knew the information, but we couldn't produce the information because in our mind, the associated thoughts were irrelevant. This is the issue I wish to resolve with using obsidian, where a mind map can easily be made, connecting kanji, sentences, and words to the different pieces of content they came from and each other.

As I said before, Flash cards are a great learning tool and anki recieves great support from its community, but it's often a tediuos task to write out all the cards, look up definitions and translations, and then review everything. This time could be better spent listening, reading, writing, or speaking instead. I believe that learning from the source materials that you love is the path of least resistance for most language learners and hence Japanese Content 2 Md And Anki. A few .txt files and one short command later and you're given several MD files that contain most of the data that you could want. From there, you'll have to use a plugin to create the links (PUT THE LINK HERE WHEN YOU FIND THE ONE), obsidian to anki (https://github.com/Pseudonium/Obsidian_to_Anki), and you could use Obsidian's Graph view but I also must shoutout this mind map plugin (https://github.com/lynchjames/obsidian-mind-map) and you have a visual map that you could always use in any scenario where you have forgotten something!
